## Yo!

I'm Matt, and I'm a software engineer and robotics researcher.

- :robot: Iâ€™m currently working in the [HIRO](https://github.com/HIRO-group) group as a undergraduate researcher. I previously was a software engineer intern at Microsoft. I also have a side hustle as an undergraduate researcher at the [SBS](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/sbs) lab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning reinforcement learning and its applications in robotics - more specifically, robotic manipulators and quadrotors.
- :runner: I love to run, bike, and swim.
-  âš¡ Languages: Python, C++, Typescript, C#, ä¸­æ–‡ (in progress)
- :bulb: Random aside - check out this [repo](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/flightmare) from UZH-RPG. It's REALLY good.
