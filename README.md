## Yo!

I'm Matt, and I'm a software engineer and robotics researcher.

- :robot: I’m currently working in the [HIRO](https://github.com/HIRO-group) group as an undergraduate researcher. I previously was a software engineer intern at Microsoft. I'm also an undergraduate researcher in the [SBS](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/sbs) lab.
- 🌱 I’m currently performing research on a robotic skin through environment informed control, as well as RL+robotics.
- :runner: I enjoy biking, running, and swimming.
-  ⚡ Languages: Python, C++, Typescript, C#, 中文 (in progress)
- :bulb: Random aside - check out this cool [repo](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/flightmare) from UZH-RPG.
